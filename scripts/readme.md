# Scripts

This scripts are exported in the [custom profile](../custom_profile.sh) file, so they can be called from anywhere by simply typing the script's name

This is how you export the scripts

``` bash
export PATH="/mnt/repos/th3fishMk/fedscripts/scripts:$PATH"
```

and this is how you run them:

```bash
pending-gits.sh
```

Simple and family friendly
